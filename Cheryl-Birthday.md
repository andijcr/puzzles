# Cheryl Birthday

## Problem

Albert and Bernard have just met Cheryl. *“When is your birthday?”* Albert asked Cheryl. Cheryl thought for a moment and said, *“I won’t tell you, but I’ll give you some clues”*. She wrote down a list of ten dates:

* May 15, May 16, May 19
* June 17, June 18
* July 14, July 16
* August 14, August 15, August 17

*“One of these is my birthday”* she said.

Cheryl whispered in Albert’s ear the month, and only the month, of her birthday. To Bernard, she whispered the day, and only the day. *“Can you figure it out now?”* she asked Albert.

**Albert**: *“I don’t know when your birthday is, but I know Bernard doesn’t know, either.”*

**Bernard**: *“I didn’t know originally, but now I do.”*

**Albert**: *“Well, now I know, too!”*

When is Cheryl’s birthday?

## Solution

### From first sentence

Albert says:

*"I don’t know when your birthday is, ..."*

There no single month dates, so no more information provided

*"... but I know Bernard doesn’t know, either.”*

This excludes dates of May and Jun because May 19 and Jun 18 are dates with unique day values

* <s>May 15</s>, <s>May 16</s>, <s>May 19</s>
* <s>June 17</s>, <s>June 18</s>
* July 14, July 16
* August 14, August 15, August 17
